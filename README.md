# Carrier

Carrier is a [Kubernetes controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) for running and
scaling [game servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

This project is inspired by [agones](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones).

## Introduction

Generally speaking, the online multiplayer games such as competitive [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter)s
and [MOBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena)s, require
a [Dedicated Game Server(DS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server#Dedicated_server) which simulating game worlds, and players connect to the server with
separate client programs, then playing within it.

Dedicated game servers are stateful applications that retain the full game simulation in memory. But unlike other stateful applications, such as databases, they
have a short lifetime. Rather than running for months or years, a dedicated game server process will exit when a game is over, which usually lasts a few minutes
or hours.

The Kubernetes [Statefulset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) workload does not manage such applications well. Carrier
communicates with the game server through the SDK, and dedicated server can notify the Carrier when no player whthin it, then the Carrier can delete
the [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) safely. Conversely, when scaling down the Kubernetes cluster, Carrier can also notify the game
server through the SDK, which allows the Carrier to better running and scaling the game server.

## Main Features

### Good Scalability

Carrier provides many extensions to communicate with game server and services out of K8s clusters.

- SDK

  communicate with game server directly, which enables game server runtime fetching the `GameServer` status running in K8s, e.g. LB Status, Labels and
  Annotations.

- Webhook(Readiness/Deletable)

  this extension helps user to define when a `GameServer` is ready or can be deleted. Carrier will fetch the `GameServer` status from webhook servers developed
  by users according to the protocol.

### Scale down GameServers in order

There are many players on different `GameServer`. Since carrier do not allow scaling down a `GameServer` when it is not deletable, carrier should scale down
the `GameServers` in order to avoid waiting long time. An annotation named `carrier.ocgi.dev/gs-deletion-cost` is used for helping sort the `GameServers`. This
annotation can be added by `SDK` or set `carrier.ocgi.dev/gs-cost-metrics-name` to enable fetching metrics to set `carrier.ocgi.dev/gs-deletion-cost`.

### Update Policy

We support some policies to Update `Squad`.

- Recreate
- RollingUpdate
- CanaryUpdate
- InPlaceUpdate

## Application architecture based on Carrier

Hereâ€™s an example of dedicated game server architecture based on Carrier.

![The overall game server architecture](./docs/img/application_architecture.png)

- **MatchMaker** Responsible for match making (developed by the application)

- **Dscenter** Responsible for `Dedicated Server` management and allocation (developed by the application)

- **Dedicated Server** Corresponds to a `GameServer`, manages multiple DS processes, and reports ds information to `Dscenter`. `Dedicated Server`
  and `Carrier-SDK` as a whole are deployed in the same K8s Pod

- **Carrier Controller** Manage a group of `GameServers`(include create, update, delete) and maintain a certain number of replicas of the DS cluster

- **Autoscaler** Calculate and adjust the number of replicas of the DS cluster according to application metrics, events, time, etc.

## Quick Start

Build and deploy the Carrier.

### Build

```shell script
# make container
```

### Deploy

```shell script
# # change the image version if you would like to deploy a specified version(default: latest).

# kubectl apply -f manifeasts/crd.yaml
# kubectl apply -f manifeasts/deploy.yaml
```
